# Compiler Design

A *simple* compiler designed to work on the Tastier language. :cold_sweat:

Mostly written using a mix of C# and Assembly 

The compiler can carry out a number of functions including:
1. Statements (if/for-loops/while-loops etc.)
2. Function Calling
3. Array Handling
4. Auto-commenting of code
